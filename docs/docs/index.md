## Why *another* to-do list app
Numbat tasks aims to be a personal to-do list app in the Goldilocks zone between too simple and too complex. 
There are [thousands of half built](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/)
to-do list apps out there, usually with about 3 commits last touched 5 years ago. There is a handful of 
well-supported and maintained projects, but many of them say things like "Jira replacement with Kanban boards, 
gantt chart, and burndown charts that the whole team can use". 

I wanted a privacy-friendly place to put my shopping list that I felt comfortable exposing to the internet.

Plus, nothing says "procrastinating" like building a massively over-engineered to-do list app,
rather than actually doing things.
