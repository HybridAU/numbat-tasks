# numbat-tasks
To-do list app

## Status
This is currently in development, enough of the API is fleshed out that I can start on the front end. Once I've got an MVP there are many more things I'd like to add:

- [ ] More Linting
  - [ ] Code review doctor
  - [ ] Dependabot
- [ ] Automation (build release docker images)
- [ ] Webauthn for login
- [ ] Reorder / custom order for tasks
- [ ] Share tasks lists with other users
- [ ] Progressive web app

The irony of having an unfinished todo list written in markdown, on a todo list app is not lost on me.
