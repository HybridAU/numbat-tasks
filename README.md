A self-hosted to-do list app

## Why *another* to-do list app
Numbat tasks aims to be a personal to-do list app in the Goldilocks zone between too simple and too complex. 
There are [thousands of half built](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/)
to-do list apps out there, usually with about 3 commits last touched 5 years ago. There is a handful of 
well-supported and maintained projects, but many of them say things like "Jira replacement with Kanban boards, 
gantt charts, and burndown charts that the whole team can use". 

I wanted a privacy-friendly place to put my shopping list that I felt comfortable exposing to the internet.

Plus, nothing says "procrastinating" like building a massively over-engineered to-do list app,
rather than actually doing things.

## Status
This still very much a work in progress, there are some core features missing (listed below).
It's stable enough. With features that it already exist, I've managed to use it myself
as my daily to-do list app for things like my shopping list for over a year.

## Documentation
Interested? Go [read the docs](https://docs.numbat-tasks.com/getting_started/) to see how to get started.

## Core missing features
- [ ] A nice frontend to [manage users](https://github.com/HybridAU/numbat-tasks/issues/32).
- [ ] Webauthn for login
- [ ] Share tasks lists with other users
- [ ] Start date / Due date for 
  - [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Sub tasks
- [ ] Play a happy chime when a task is marked as completed

The irony of having a to-do list written in Markdown, on a to-do list app is not lost on me.
